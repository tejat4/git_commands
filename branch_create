------Git is trying to create a branch called main based on an existing commit or branch, but:

Your repo has no commits yet.

Therefore, there's nothing to base a branch on.

So Git doesn’t know where to “point” the new branch main.

✅ How to Fix It

You need to make at least one commit first — then you can create new branches.

🔧 Fix in 3 Steps:
1. Create a file
echo "# My Project" > README.md

2. Add and commit the file
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"


Now your repo has a commit — Git can create branches.

3. Create the main branch
git branch main


OR better, rename the current branch to main:

git branch -m main


✅ Now you're on main, and everything works.

Bonus: Avoid This in Future

Set Git to use main as default for all new repos:

git config --global init.defaultBranch main

------------
1. Check Your Current Branch
  git branch


This shows your current branch (e.g., main or master).

🔸 2. Create a New Branch
git branch branch_name
