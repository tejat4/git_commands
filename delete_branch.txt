git branch -d branch_name

This deletes the branch only if it‚Äôs fully merged to avoid losing work.

---If the branch is not merged and you want to force delete it:

git branch -D branch_name

--- Delete a Branch Remotely (on GitHub)
git push origin --delete branch_name


or

git push origin :branch_name

git checkout main
