//delete the file in a branch

1. Delete the file using (git rm)

This removes the file and stages the deletion:

git rm <filename>

Example:

git rm delete_file.txt


ðŸ’¡ This is better than using rm or del because it tells Git to track the deletion immediately.

2. Commit the deletion
git commit -m "Deleted delete_file.txt"

3. (Optional) Push the change to remote (like GitHub):
git push origin <branch-name>


Example:

git push origin main

ðŸ”„ Alternative: If you already deleted the file manually (with rm or through a file manager):

You can still stage the deletion like this:

git rm delete_file.txt


Or just:

git add delete_file.txt


Git will recognize it's been deleted and stage that change.

ðŸ§¼ Optional: If you want to delete the file only locally (not in Git history):

Just use:

rm delete_file.txt


But donâ€™t commit it. This will leave Git seeing it as a missing or modified file.
